Skimming is a technique based on reading quickly to indetify major points.


FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1 - read the introductory paragraph entirely.

2 - then read the first sentence of each of the middle paragraph.

3 - then read the entirely concluding paragraph.

OBS: When practing this try reading the passage twice; the first time skimming the passage to get the main ideias, after that, read the passage more carefully to see if you really DID get those main ideias.
